abstract: The traditional “border effect” literature finds that political boundaries have a huge impact on the price dispersion across countries. In this paper, an online transaction dataset of 55 countries over 9 consecutive years from eBay is used to examine the online border effect. The weighted price dispersion indexes are constructed, and quantile regression method and the traditional regression method are both applied to estimate the online border effect. The main result indicates that the distance effect on the cross-border price dispersion is not as important as the offline one but the border effect still exists online. Common language, currency and being within the advanced country group in general help reduce the online price dispersion while the online auction mechanism and the power ranking system have positive effects on the price dispersion.

# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
