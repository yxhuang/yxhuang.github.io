I am a Data Scientist & Professional Educator at [RStudio](https://rstudio.com), where I work to help people learn and use programming to do better work in less time, with less friction, and (perhaps) more joy. 

I love working with data scientists across the spectrum- from beginners to advanced users- and particularly enjoy using software tools to create educational materials that enlighten and engage learners. Topics I teach range from literate programming to machine learning. My teaching materials have been used by [NASA](https://open.nasa.gov/explore/datanauts/), [Pew Research Center](https://medium.com/pew-research-center-decoded/using-tidyverse-tools-with-pew-research-center-survey-data-in-r-bdfe61de0909), [University of Oregon](https://github.com/uo-datasci-specialization), and now [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/).
