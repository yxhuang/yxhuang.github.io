Welcome to my site!

I'm a Economics Ph.D. Candidate from the [Goeroge Washinton University](https://economics.columbian.gwu.edu/). My field of study is international macroeconomics, with a special focus on macroeconomic policies.

Before studying at GWU, I obtained dual bachelor degrees in Finance and Statistics from South China Agricultural University. During my graduate study in the U.S., I also worked at the eBay research office (DC), the [Internet Association](https://internetassociation.org/) and the [International Monetary Fund](https://www.imf.org/external/index.htm). I have a passion for both research and teaching economics. 

I am on the job market 2019-2020 and will be available for interviews at the 2020 ASSA Annual Meeting in San Diego.
