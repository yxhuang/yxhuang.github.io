abstract: In this paper, I propose a new classification method of sterilized intervention tool regimes and construct a new dataset for sterilization regimes for 41 countries over 26 years. The main aim of this research is to provide a sterilization classification framework and compare the different sterilized intervention methods to see what the optimal choice for central banks will be to conduct sterilized intervention under different economic situation. Multi-logit models with three-stage choice dependent variable were used to study the sterilized intervention tools choices. The results show that financial openness, financial development and capital inflow surge scenes seem to be the main factors affecting the choices of different sterilization tools. The fiscal cost of interest payments does not play an important role in making the decisions.
