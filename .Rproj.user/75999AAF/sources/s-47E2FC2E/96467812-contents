abstract: The co-movement of asset prices is a core issue in the field of finance. Based on the price indices of China's housing market and stock markets during 2000-2010, this paper thoroughly analyzes the dominance and functional mechanism of the two-way spillover effects between two capital markets and conducts multi-stage study according to different market circumstances by using the empirical methods including VEC models, Generalized Impulse Response Functions and etc. The empirical results indicate that a long-term equilibrium relationship exists between housing prices and stock prices. Consistent with the expectation of wealth effects or credit expansion effects, stock prices have significantly positive impact on housing prices, however housing prices have certain significantly negative effect on stock prices, which is consistent with the expectation of asset substitution effects. Moreover, this paper also finds that stock prices play a dominant role in the spillover effects between two capital markets in terms of short-term causality supporting wealth effects or credit expansion effects and the empirical result only supports a one-way causality. Finally, as macroeconomic circumstances and economic policies change, the dominance and functional mechanism of spillover effects between housing prices and stock prices exhibit significant differences at three stages.
