abstract: Digitalization is transforming the global economy, but little is known about its macroeconomic implications. In this paper, we examine the extent to which digitalization—measured by a new proxy based on IP addresses allocations per country—has influenced inflation dynamics in a sample of 21 advanced and emerging economies over 2000-2017. Phillips curve estimates show that digitalization has a statistically significant negative effect on inflation in the short run. Its economic impact is not large but has increased since 2012. Our estimates suggest that digitalization mainly operates through a cost/competition channel. Principal components and cointegration analysis further suggest digitalization is a key driver of lower structural inflation.
