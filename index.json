In this paper, we examine the extent to which digitalization—measured by a new proxy based on IP addresses allocations per country—has influenced inflation dynamics in a sample of 21 advanced and emerging economies over 2000-2017. Phillips curve estimates show that digitalization has a statistically significant negative effect on inflation in the short run. Its economic impact is not large but has increased since 2012. Our estimates suggest that digitalization mainly operates through a cost/competition channel. Principal components and cointegration analysis further suggest digitalization is a key driver of lower structural inflation.","tags":["Source Themes"],"title":"Is Digitalization Driving Domestic Inflation?","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Yuxuan Huang"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1572393600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1572393600,"objectID":"ccbe31b01d654c93901227812b33f324","permalink":"/yxhuang.github.io/publication/2019-rr/","publishdate":"2019-10-30T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/yxhuang.github.io/publication/2019-rr/","section":"publication","summary":"Reserve requirement changes have been a widely employed monetary policy and macroprudential tool in last decade. Countries may choose this policy, which effectively changes the cost of deposit financing for banks, instead of an interest rate change to avoid influences on capital flows and exchange rates. Such a nonmarket based policy tool can lead to distortionary macroeconomic effects by changing the relative cost of different financing options. Given both its widespread use and the potential to shape financial market outcomes, understanding its impact is important. This article adds new cross-country empirical evidence of reserve requirement changes’ effects on lending-deposit interest rate spreads based on a country-level panel dataset of 75 countries from 1980 to 2015. Demonstrating the impact on the spread is important as it highlights the impact of reserve requirement policies and how they can shape funding decisions. The theoretical framework indicates that the effects of reserve requirement rate changes on the interest rate spread depend on countries’ financial market conditions such as financial market development. The empirical result shows that raising reserve requirements on average widen the lending-deposit interest rate spread. Such impacts are dampened for countries with more developed financial markets. The impacts of reserve requirement changes on the interest rate spread are further confirmed by propensity score matching estimators that address the self-selection bias associated with reserve requirement hikes. The results are robust to different covariate measures and various treatment effect estimators.","tags":["Source Themes"],"title":"Reserve requirement policy and interest rate spread","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Yuxuan Huang"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1572393600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1572393600,"objectID":"789911800d03379b76d091fa995e45c8","permalink":"/yxhuang.github.io/publication/2019-sterilization/","publishdate":"2019-10-30T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/yxhuang.github.io/publication/2019-sterilization/","section":"publication","summary":"A new classification method of sterilized intervention tool regimes and construct a new dataset for sterilization regimes.","tags":["Source Themes"],"title":"The Choice of Sterilized Intervention Tools","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Yuxuan Huang (Instructor)"],"categories":["course"],"content":"\rA undergraduate intermedia level economics course.\n","date":1568592000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1568592000,"objectID":"0b9ecb896cddbab743bb90e855ac47f4","permalink":"/yxhuang.github.io/courses/2016summer-econ2180/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/yxhuang.github.io/courses/2016summer-econ2180/","section":"courses","summary":"A undergraduate intermedia level economics course.

This paper comparesthe performance of six different forecasting models of USD/CNY exchange rate under three different forecast scenarios from 2005-2015. In particular, the paper focuses in answering the following questions. (i) Do models' forecast performance change when the marketization level changes? (ii) Which model has the best forecast when the regimes change? (iii) Can forecasting robustifications help? The forecast results show that models incorporates economic fundamentals perform better in less regulated periods when the exchange rate can oat more freely. For the forecast experiments with breaks in the forecast origin, the exchange rate CVAR model perform the best before robustifications. In most cases, the intercept-correction and double-difference device improve the forecast performance in both dynamic forecast and one-step forecast. Different models seem to do well under different forecast scenario after applying the robust devices.","tags":["Source Themes"],"title":"Reserve requirement policy and interest rate spread","type":"publication"}]
